## Description

For the backend API, we use Node js to create endpoints. We are trying to create an endpoint deployed on the App engine. For the database, we use cloud mongoDB to store NoSQL databases such as users, user history, and article collections. Meanwhile, for machine learning model APIs we use Flask and Docker. We are trying to create an endpoint deployed on Cloud Run.
